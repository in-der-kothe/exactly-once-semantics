# Impossible problem?

Even if the problem of the [two generals](https://github.com/in-der-kothe/exactly-once-semantics/tree/theory/two-generals)[^1] is impossible to solve there are algorithms & strategies to ensure [common knowledge](https://github.com/in-der-kothe/exactly-once-semantics/tree/theory/common-knowledge) of the imformation.

To test strategies and the problems behind them you find different approaches in this repository under `code`.
