# The two generals

(inspired by https://blog.bulloak.io/post/20200910-two-generals-problem/)

## The problem
Two armies (red and blue). The blue one is in a vally and on opposite mountains the red one is deployed with one general for ervery side.

Goal: red must start one combined attak of blue to win

Problem: how to establish a secure communication between these two generals / armies to be sure both armies attak at the same time

The communication only works with messengers, which must be send through the hostile valley.

Risk: messengers could be caught, compromised, exchanged, ...
