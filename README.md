# Delivery guarantees in distributed systems

The purpose of this repository is to raise awareness to some of ocurring problems in distributed systems. \
It provides explanations and a strategies to handle them.

The repository is divided in several branches which represent the different chapters / learnings:
- The :book: / `theory` branches explaining the problems and thought experiments. 
- The :computer: / `code` branches provide code for exploring the programmatic strategies.
